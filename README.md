# 📝 Portfolio Website Inspired by Notes App

Welcome to my portfolio project!  
This website is a personal portfolio inspired by the clean, minimalistic design of a notes application. ✨

While making notes in my phone's notes app, I realized the layout was simple yet effective.  
I decided to use this idea and recreate that minimal and clean feel for my portfolio site — making it unique and personal!
